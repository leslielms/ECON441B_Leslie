      "3. \"Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.\" - This statement is not entirely accurate. The term 'artificial intelligence' was coined in 1956, but it was studied as a discipline before that under different names.\n",
      "4. \"This led to the AI spring of the early 2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the United States pioneering significant advances in artificial intelligence.\" - It falsely implies that only organizations based in the United States are pioneering AI advances. AI research and advances happen worldwide.\n",
      "5. \"General intelligence (the ability to complete any task performable by a human) is among the field's long-term goals.\" - Misrepresentation of General Intelligence. General intelligence refers to the ability to understand, learn and apply knowledge across a variety of tasks, not necessarily \"any task performable by a human.\" \n",
      "6. \"In classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.\" - This statement is inaccurate because in an artificial system, an agent can't always predict the exact outcome because of the inherent uncertainties and dynamic complexities.\n",
      "7. \"Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically.\" - Inaccuracy in the definition of Machine Learning. It is actually a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. \"They have won 121 NCAA team championships, second only to Stanford University's 128 team titles.\" - As of 2021, UCLA has won 119 NCAA championships, not 121. Stanford University has won 126, not 128.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. \"The facility included a demonstration school where teachers-in-training could practice their techniques with children. That elementary school would become the present day UCLA Lab School.\" - The UCLA Lab School was not initially part of the training sites for teachers-in-training as the text suggests.\n",

      "5. \"On February 1, 1927, the Regents renamed the Southern Branch the University of California at Los Angeles.\" - The date is not wrong, but the name is wrong. The name was changed to \"University of California, Los Angeles,\" not \"at Los Angeles.\"\n",
